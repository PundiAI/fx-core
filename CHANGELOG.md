## [v7.5.0]

### Enhancements and New Features

* Support for Solidity Contract Bridge Call: Added functionality to enable bridge calls to Solidity contracts, enhancing interoperability across different blockchain networks.
* Automatic Refund and bridgeCallback Interface: Introduced automatic refund mechanisms and the bridgeCallback interface to improve the efficiency and reliability of bridge transactions.
* Pre-compiled Contracts Bridge Call: Enabled support for pre-compiled contracts to perform bridge calls, facilitating smoother and more efficient crosschain operations.
* IBC Bridge Call to fxCore-EVM: Added support for IBC bridge calls to fxCore-EVM, expanding crosschain communication capabilities.
* Pending Pool for Low Liquidity: Implemented a system to add crosschain requests to a pending pool when liquidity is low, ensuring transaction reliability even under constrained conditions.
* Added fxcored export-delegates Command: This feature allows users to export all delegation records from the blockchain, excluding contract delegations.
* Precompiled Staking v2 Contract: Introduced a new precompiled staking v2 contract, with v1 version to be deprecated in future releases.
